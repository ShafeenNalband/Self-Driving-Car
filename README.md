# Self-Driving-Car

A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, driverless car, or robotic car, is a car incorporating vehicular automation, that is, a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a self-driving car using Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator. The simulator provides a virtual environment to test and refine algorithms, allowing the vehicle to navigate autonomously based on machine learning models and sensor inputs.
